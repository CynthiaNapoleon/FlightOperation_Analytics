#Aviation-Ripple-Effect-Analysis
Investigating the 'Ripple Effect': A SQL driven analysis of how aggressive flight scheduling impacts crew fatigue and operational safety. Leveraging Excel for data pre-processing, SQL for surfacing business questions and Tableau for executive-level storytelling, this project transforms 130k+records into a proactive risk management framework. 

##**Project Background**
In 2024, Aurora Pacific Airways (APA) hit a critical operational plateau. Despite increasing flight volumes, the network began experiencing rising volatility and a noticeable degradation in On-Time Performance (OTP). The airline's leadership recognized that the existing schedule was no longer capable of absorbing minor shocks, but they lacked a unified view of where and how operational minutes were being lost.

To prevent system-wide failure, the Operations Department commissioned this diagnostic audit across four critical areas:
1)Network Operations: To identify where the network is physically "hemorrhaging" minutes and pinpoint seasonal failure points.
2)Crew Logistics: To evaluate crew base performance and identify role-based friction that prevents on-time departures.
3)Safety & Vulnerability: To analyze the relationship between procedural safety and operational reliability.
4)Infrastructure Management: To determine which airports of the APA network have reached a point of physical saturation.

The Goal: Shift from "Reactive Firefighting" to "Proactive Resilience"—reclaiming lost minutes and bulletproofing the 2025 schedule.
